        Some quick concepts assuming that you have some Python knowledge already:
            PGWrapper is a class. A class is a template for creating objects with user defined properties and methods. An instance is an object created with this class.
            This function is the constructor of the PGWrapper class.
            A class constructor is a special function of a class that is executed whenever we create new objects of that class.
            self is a reference to the object to be created using this class

        PGWrapper constructor. Validates if the passed config follows the expected schema and sets the __autocommit and __config properties.

        :param config: dict -> Config dictionary with the postgres database connection parameters.
                            It must follow the schema in the database_config_validator object defined above
        :param autocommit: bool -> Boolean value that can be set to False if you want more control on committing database transactions
        """
        self.__autocommit = autocommit
        self.__config = database_config_validator.validate(config)

    def __enter__(self):
        """
        This is magic method in Python called a dunder. It adds extra functionality to your instances created with this class.
        This particular dunder implements a context manager in Python and it allows you to write code as following:
            with PGWrapper(config) as db_con:
                results = db_con.query_as_list_of_dicts("SELECT * FROM information_schema.schemata")
        Whilst the usual way (which you can still use anyway) would be:
            db_con = PGWrapper(config)
            db_con.connect()
            results = db_con.query_as_list_of_dicts("SELECT * FROM information_schema.schemata")

        The benefits of using a context manager is that the Python Garbage Collector (quick useful link https://towardsdatascience.com/memory-management-and-garbage-collection-in-python-c1cb51d1612c)
        cleans the instance created with this class as soon as its context is finished. At the end it runs code that you implement in the __exit__ dunder.
        In the case of a database connection you might want to add a connect_to_some_db() in the __enter__ and a close_some_db_connection() in the __exit__ dunder.

        Attempts to close the connection on exit from the context manager. It uses the self.close method defined below.

        Some quick information:
            A contextmanager class is any class that implements the __enter__ and __exit__ methods according to the Python Language Referenceâ€™s context management protocol.
            Implementing the context management protocol enables you to use the with statement with instances of the class. The with statement is used to ensure that setup
            and teardown operations are always executed before and after a given block of code.
            It is functionally equivalent to try...finally blocks, except that with statements are more concise.

            The parameters of this method describe the exception that caused the context to be exited.
            If the context was exited without an exception, all three arguments will be None.
